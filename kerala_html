<h3>Geography</h3>
<img class="img" src="map.png" style="float:right;">
<p class="border">
Kerala (38,863 km²; 1.18% of <b>India’s</b> landmass) is situated between the <b>Arabian Sea</b> to the west and the <b>Western Ghats</b> to the east. Kerala’s coast runs some 580 km in length, while the state itself varies between 35–120 km in width. Geographically, Kerala roughly divides into three climatically distinct regions. These include the eastern highlands (rugged and cool mountainous terrain), the central midlands (rolling hills), and the western lowlands (coastal plains). Located at the extreme southern tip of the <b>Indian subcontinent</b>, Kerala lies near the center of the <b>Indian tectonic plate</b> (the Indian Plate); as such most of the state (notwithstanding isolated regions) is subject to comparatively little <b>seismic</b> or <b>volcanic activity</b>.

<center><h3>Season To Visit</h3></center>
<div >
<p>Though Kerala is a year-round destination, the best season to visit Kerala depends on which place in Kerala you're visiting. While some places are most enjoyable during the monsoons, others are best visited during the winter season. Overall, the best time to visit Kerala is during September to March, when the weather is pleasant, making it easy for tourists to explore the myriad facets of the state - the hill stations, beaches and backwaters.
 The best time to visit backwaters in Kerala is the winter season, which is from November through February. It is when the weather in Kerala is pleasant for local sightseeing and boat excursions in the backwaters. Being the peak tourist season, winter is also the best time to visit Kerala with family for a memorable holiday. On the other hand, the hill stations in Kerala like Munnar receive thousands of visitors in the summer season, from April to June. It is not advisable to visit Kerala in monsoon season. </p>
