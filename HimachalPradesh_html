<h4>Himachal Pradesh</h4>
<p>
  Himachal Pradesh is a state of India located in North India. Situated in the Western Himalayas, it is bordered by states of Jammu and Kashmir on the north, Punjab on the west, Haryana on the southwest, Uttarakhand on the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the east. At its southernmost point, it also touches the state of Uttar Pradesh. The state's name was coined from the Sanskrit—Him means 'snow' and achal means 'land' or 'abode'—by acharya Diwakar Datt Sharma, one of the state's eminent Sanskrit scholars.

  Himachal Pradesh is known for its natural environment, hill stations, and temples. Himachal Pradesh had one of the highest per-capita incomes among Indian states and union territories for the year 2014-15. Many perennial rivers flow in the state. Numerous plants produce surplus hydroelectricity that is sold to other states, such as Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan. Tourism and agriculture are also important constituents of the state's economy.

<h3>Geography</h3>
<img class="img" src="map of himachal pradesh.jpg" style="float:right;">
<p class="border">
Himachal is in the western <b>Himalayas</b>. Covering an area of 55,673 square kilometres (21,495 sq mi), it is a mountainous state. Most of the state lies on the foothills of the <b>Dhauladhar</b> Range. At 7,025 m Shilla is the highest mountain peak in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
<br><br>
Due to extreme variation in elevation, great variation occurs in the climatic conditions of Himachal . The climate varies from hot and subhumid tropical in the southern tracts to, with more elevation, cold, alpine, and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges. The state's winter capital, <b>Dharamsala</b> receives very heavy rainfall, while areas like <b>Lahaul and Spiti</b> are cold and almost rainless. Broadly, Himachal experiences three seasons: summer, winter, and rainy season. Summer lasts from mid-April till the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in the alpine zone which experiences a mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from 28 to 32 °C (82 to 90 °F). Winter lasts from late November till mid March. <b>Snowfall</b> is common in alpine tracts (generally above 2,200 metres (7,218 ft) i.e. in the higher and trans-Himalayan region).
