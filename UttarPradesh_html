  <p class="border">
    Uttar Pradesh, with a total area of 243,290 square kilometres (93,935 sq mi), is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area and is roughly of same size as United Kingdom. It is situated on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north,[56] but the plains that cover most of the state are distinctly different from those high mountains.[57] The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai.[58] The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south.It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus.

<p>It is best to visit Uttar Pradesh between Octobers to March inspite of the fact that the major cities remain crowded by the tourists all the year round. The summers are simply torrid and you could be the victim of the heat or sun stroke which is known as Loo in the local language. The Best Time to Visit Uttar Pradesh will also depend on the fairs and festivals that take place in the months from October to March.
